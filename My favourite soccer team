My favourite soccer team is Real Madrid. This team aquired approximately 15 Champions League in the span of a century.
This feat is impressive when tooken into consideration the success of other teams.
Take Liverpool FC for example, this team only managed to win 6 Champions league, and there circulated with bein the 2nd best team in FIFA's history. 
All of this and their heoric players accumulate to the success of Real madrid.
Ultimately, this team is unanimously agreed upon to be the best team in soccer history.
Also, to finish my favourite soccer player Kylian Mbappe joined this team.
